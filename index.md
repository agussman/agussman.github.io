## fit-converter.com

I went for a run and somehow the Garmin .fit file got corrupted. Which really annoyed me because I was pretty sure I had set a PR for the year on the run. Anyway, one thing led to another and I made a site to convert corrupt @Garmin .FIT files into .GPX files that can still be imported into Garmin Connect: [fit-converter.com](http://fit-converter.com).

The site is written in Python 3 and Angular 5. The backend deploys to AWS Lambda using AWS Chalice. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/agussman/garmin-fit-fix).
