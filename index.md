# Projects

## AWS Neptune

[This project](https://github.com/agussman/coredex) includes a getting started guide to AWS Neptune; how to launch it, insert data manually and programmatincally, and visualize it with GraphExp.

Additionally, there are [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p1C1NOKNhbwJ3cCUqECOSXqnz-3-wlLpIjt4Ftbcc80/edit?usp=sharing) and [only marginally-awkward video](https://youtu.be/-7ukAnT51CI?t=1900) that provide an introduction and an overview of Graph Databases and go through the project.


## fit-converter.com

I went for a run and somehow the Garmin .fit file got corrupted. Which really annoyed me because I was pretty sure I had set a PR for the year on the run. Anyway, one thing led to another and I made a site to convert corrupt @Garmin .FIT files into .GPX files that can still be imported into Garmin Connect: [fit-converter.com](http://fit-converter.com).

The site is written in Python 3 and Angular 5. The backend deploys to AWS Lambda using AWS Chalice. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/agussman/garmin-fit-fix).

## Satellites Above [Alexa Skill]

[This Alexa skill](https://github.com/agussman/satellites_above) accesses the user-provided device location, geolocates it, and queries the N2YO api to count the number of satellites overhead at that exactly moment.

It's available in the [Alexa Skill Marketplace](https://www.amazon.com/%F0%9F%8D%92-percontate-Satellites-Above/dp/B07K6M15TC/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=satellites+above&qid=1550684579&s=digital-skills&sr=1-1-catcorr)
