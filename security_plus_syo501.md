    * Persistent / stored - everyone gets it who goes to the page, untargetted
  * Cross-site Request Forgery XSRF, CSRF [(2:48)](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-501/cross-site-request-forgery/)
    * Web app should prevent it

  * DNS Poisoning and Domain Hijacking
    * https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-501/dns-poisoning-and-domain-hijacking/

    * filter at OSI Layer 4 ()
    * OSI Layer 7 - Application filtering option
    * Often used as VPN concentrators
    * does Network Address Translation

    * stateful - tracks outgoing connections, allows response, mostly this now
    * "application layer gateway" looking at the packet, 
    * host-based?
    * ACLs - (dis)allow traffics
    * Application-based vs. network-based
