# Magic: The Gathering Collection Management

There are a nuber of different tools avaiable for managing and organizing your MTG collection. I'm trying to (re)enter all my cards into a system and figured I'd compile my notes in a community-friendly way.

Some of the things I'm looking for:
 * I need a web interface. Anything soley on the phone won't work.
 * I want more than just deck management; I actually want to be able to support searching my entire inventory of cards.
 * I deal with a lot of Foils and so it should support that as easily as possible
 
 ## Data Entry / Scanning Apps
 
 * [Delver Lens](https://delverlab.com/)
   * :+1: App available for Android and iOS
   * :+1: Overall seems very good.
   * :-1: Has it's own internal collection management capabilities, but no web interface.
   * You need to pay to export more than 100 cards at a time, but the free capabilities seem pretty generous.
 * [CardCastle](https://cardcastle.co/)
   * Has a scanning app, haven't tested it because CardCastle is low on the list (see below)
 
 ## Collection Management
 
  * [Deckbox](https://deckbox.org/)
    * Closest thing to a gold standard for collection management.
    * This is what I've been using, but I'm not thrilled with it. It's tedious to enter cards and the filtering/search is just wonky.
  * [CardCastle](https://cardcastle.co/)
    * Looks promising
    * :-1: Free tier only allows up to 1,000 cards
    * :-1: Pay tier at $4/month more than what I'm looking for right now.
  * [Archidekt](https://archidekt.com/)
    + :+1: Great UX
    - :-1: Only really supports Decks, no Collection support
    - :-1: Can't import "Foil" status
  * [MTG Collection Builder](https://mtgcollectionbuilder.com/)
    * Really focused around collecting one of each card.
    * Organized around Sets and % completion
    * Doesn't have support for Decks
  * [TCGplayer](https://tcgplayer.com)
    * No import or export
    * a host of UI antipatterns
  * [MTGAHelper](https://mtgahelper.com/)
    * MTG Arena only
  
  
## Other Sites

 * [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/)
   * Rules in every possible way.
 * [Cube Tutor](https://www.cubetutor.com/)
   * Market leader in Cube management
   * Mostly pretty good, but seems to be having support issues
 * [Cube Cobra](https://cubecobra.com/)
   * Looks good, intend to try it out
