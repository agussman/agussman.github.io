# Magic: The Gathering Collection Management

There are a nuber of different tools avaiable for managing and organizing your MTG collection. I'm trying to (re)enter all my cards into a system and figured I'd compile my notes in a community-friendly way.

Some of the things I'm looking for:
 * I need a web interface. Anything soley on the phone won't work.
 * I want more than just deck management; I actually want to be able to support searching my entire inventory of cards.
